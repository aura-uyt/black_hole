I have no clue what this cmake is, what is opengl, what is dll, what is build, what is debuging, just triead out cloning and running this amazing project of black hole thought it would be easy but it took me entire day just to run the programming setting up the files etc.  

Huge respect to Kavan010 who built this project watched his yt video felt overwhelmed seeing those complex equations of mathematics i feared come alive and make this amazing black hole simulation.

I hope i will be also able to make things like these, i guess my attention span is very less neeed to incease it, and have deep downn knowledge of this things   
It all happens` brick by brick` only
